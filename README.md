# Go

This is a set of slides I made for a talk at work about Go in October 2014. I was hoping to convince the powers that be to have a serious look at using Go. It was unsuccessful. I have decided to throw up the slides just because, let me know if this is somehow useful to you.

Basically I liberally stole from slides from Rob Pike et al. found here: http://talks.golang.org/2013

## Use

This uses the Go tool 'present' to display and run the code. Look at the plain text by opening the go.slide file.

To display properly:
* install go (homebrew: brew install go)
* install present: ```go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/present```
* start up present in this directory
* open your browser
* also install the websocket library
* ```go get code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket```
