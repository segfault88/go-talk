This is a set of slides for my Go talk.

This uses the Go tool 'present' to display and run the code. Look at the plain text by opening the go.slide file.


To display properly:
install go (homebrew: brew install go)
install present: go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/present
start up present in this directory
open your browser

also install the websocket library
go get code.google.com/p/go.net/websocket
